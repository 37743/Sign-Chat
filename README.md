## Introduction:
- SIGN CHATÂ© was a phone application project that transforms written natural languages (e.g., English) to a series of ASL gestures on a grid display and vice versa.
- Development plans included usage of computer vision to implement a real-time detection of hand and facial gestures through the mobile phone's camera.
